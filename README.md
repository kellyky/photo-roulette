# photo-roulette
Ultra simple web-based game. User chooses a number, sees a photo based on the number.

## Technologies Used
* HTML

## Usage
Visit https://kellyky.github.io/photo-roulette/

Enter a number 1-3 (integers only). You'll see a different photo based on your input. 

## Notes
This is an excuse for me to practice getting user input and using Javascript to show a different result based on the input. 

## Known Bugs
No bugs in the use of the page. There's currently a clash of my new practice spec.js files that I created in my editor vs in Cypress. I have to resolve that.
